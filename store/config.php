 * The variable $blowfish_key contains your Blowfish encryption key automatically

 * sensitive data in your store including user passwords, credit card data, etc.
 *
 * NEVER try to change your Blowfish encryption key by editing the value  of the
 * $blowfish_key variable in this file: your data is already encrypted with this
 * key and X-Cart needs exactly the same key to be able to decrypt it. Changing
 * $blowfish_key manually will corrupt all the user passwords (including the
 * administrator's password), so you will not be able to use the store.
 *
 * Please be aware that a lost Blowfish key cannot be restored, so X-Cart team
 * will not be able to help you regain access to your store if you remove or
 * change the value of $blowfish_key.
 *
 * It is quite safe to use X-Cart with the Blowfish key generated during
 * installation; however, if you still want to change it, please refer to
 * X-Cart Reference Manual or contact X-Cart Tech Support for details.
